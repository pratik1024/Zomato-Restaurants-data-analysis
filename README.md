# Zomato-Restaurants-data-analysis
Analysis of Zomato Data Project Overview:

**Technology Used:**
1. **Python:** Primary programming language for data analysis and visualization.
2. **Jupyter Lab:** Integrated development environment for interactive and exploratory analysis.
3. **Seaborn:** Python library for creating statistical visualizations and informative plots.
4. **Matplotlib:** Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
5. **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis library used for handling and exploring the Zomato dataset.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Visualization:**
   - Utilizes Seaborn and Matplotlib for creating visually appealing plots, charts, and graphs.
   - Enhances understanding of attribute distribution, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Examines restaurant ratings, cost, location, cuisines, and customer reviews.
   - Involves summarizing data, finding correlations, and extracting meaningful insights.

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Compares different attributes and variables to identify trends and patterns.
   - Example: Analyzing the relationship between restaurant ratings and the cost of food.

4. **Interactive Plots:**
   - Leverages Jupyter Lab's interactive capabilities to create dynamic visualizations.
   - Allows users to explore data interactively, gaining deeper insights through plot interaction.

5. **Analysis Report:**
   - Concludes with a comprehensive analysis report summarizing key findings and trends.
   - Provides recommendations or actionable insights based on the analysis results.
